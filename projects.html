          <h5>MIS 3033 Projects</h5>
          In MIS 3033, I learned to generate a Qr Code, WPF programs, API'S, Media elements, create a website, read in data, etc. I think this was very cool
          I enjoyed feeling tech savvy telling friends I can code! I believe all of this is valuable for my future.

          <h5>Database Projects</h5>
          In my Database class, MIS 3353 we created a database for a client in which we provided them with implemented logical and physical design. At the end, 
          the client could use the data to run queries. We used excel to extract data into our server to generate queries and cereate tables, data dictonaries. 
          This project was very rewarding and tedious.

          <h5>Involvement Projects</h5>
          I was proud to be apart of a project that helped many people from the Latino community help register to vote. We held booths outside local churches 
          and provided information on how to be civically engaged and answered many questions.
