    <div class="About Me">
    Hello, my name is Viviana Gonzalez and I am a junior at the University of Oklahoma. Currently, I am a student of the Price College of Business, majoring in Accounting and Management Information Systems. I plan to obtain my CPA within the accelerated Masters of Accountancy program at OU.

I am involved within Latinos Without Borders and Voto Latino, as marketing/public relations. I serve leadership roles in both to promote higher education for Latinx communities as well as the importance of voting in underprivileged communities. Recently, I have been accepted into the highly competitive business program at Price, JCPenney Leadership Program, which will help enhance my leadership and professional skills. Alongside these activities, I continue to work part-time as a server at a local restaurant in Norman, OK. Working alongside a restaurant has helped improve my interpersonal skills, as well as my organizational and time management skills. I take pride in that I am hardworking, passionate, eager to learn and obtain a strong attention to detail. Also, I am bilingual in Spanish and English for reading, writing and speaking.

I am looking for a summer 2021 internship in Accounting or Management Information Systems. I hope to gain meaningful experience and leadership working alongside dedicated individuals who want to impact their communities in positive ways.
