    <h2>A Little About Me...</h2>
    Hello, my name is Viviana Gonzalez and I am a junior at the University of Oklahoma. Currently, I am a student of the Price College of Business, majoring in Accounting and Management Information Systems. 
    I plan to obtain my CPA within the accelerated Masters of Accountancy program at OU. I am involved within Latinos Without Borders and Voto Latino, as marketing/public relations. 
    I serve leadership roles in both to promote higher education for Latinx communities as well as the importance of voting in underprivileged communities. 
    Recently, I have been accepted into the highly competitive business program at Price, JCPenney Leadership Program, which will help enhance my leadership and professional skills. 
    Alongside these activities, I continue to work part-time as a server at a local restaurant in Norman, OK. 
    Working alongside a restaurant has helped improve my interpersonal skills, as well as my organizational and time management skills. 
    I take pride in that I am hardworking, passionate, eager to learn and obtain a strong attention to detail. 
    Also, I am bilingual in Spanish and English for reading, writing and speaking.
    I am looking for a summer 2021 internship in Accounting or Management Information Systems. I hope to gain meaningful experience and leadership working alongside dedicated individuals who want to impact their communities in positive ways.
